# Drill-Master
Drill game using JavaFX
Drill Master is a Java-based mining game developed using JavaFX, inspired by the classic game Motherload. The objective is to control a drilling machine to mine valuable minerals and gems while managing resources such as fuel and storage space. Players aim to maximize earnings before the machine runs out of fuel.

Key mechanics include drilling through various terrains, such as soil, collecting valuable minerals, and avoiding obstacles like boulders and lava. The game features realistic physics, including gravity and limited upward movement. The machine continuously consumes fuel, and game-over conditions include running out of fuel or hitting lava. The gameplay incorporates directional controls and visual feedback for machine orientation and actions.

Drill Master emphasizes game design, user interaction, and resource management while adhering to JavaFX standards. It provides an engaging experience with a clean user interface, demonstrating object-oriented programming principles and good coding practices.
